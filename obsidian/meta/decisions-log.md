## ADR-0009 — Shared animation ticker; authorized engine performance refactor

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** A performance review of the animation engine found load issues that
scale with the number of animated components on a page:
- `useLoop` started a **private `requestAnimationFrame` loop per hook instance** —
  N scroll-driven components meant N rAF loops, none of which ever stopped.
- `useWindowWidth` attached a **separate debounced `resize` listener per call** —
  one per spring component.
- `useDynamicInView` re-created its `IntersectionObserver` **on every render**
  (effect keyed on an unstable `options` object), and a dead `Proxy` branch
  created observers that were never disconnected.
- `useLoop`'s mount-only effect captured a **stale `onRender`**, so prop changes
  after mount were ignored.
All of this lives under `src/hooks/animation/` and `src/components/animation/springs/`
— `#do-not-modify` (ADR-0002).

**Decision.** With explicit user sign-off, apply a one-time performance refactor
to the protected engine, and introduce a shared, unprotected loop primitive:
- New `src/lib/animation/ticker.ts` — a single app-wide, reference-counted rAF
  loop (`subscribeToTicker`). It starts on the first subscriber, stops on the
  last, and throttles each subscriber independently. **Not** `#do-not-modify` —
  it is the supported extension point.
- `useLoop` now subscribes to the ticker and reads `onRender` / `framerate`
  through refs (fixes the stale-closure bug). Public signature unchanged.
- `useDynamicInView` rewritten without the `Proxy`: one observer, re-created only
  when the observed element or options actually change; exposes a callback ref.
- `use-window-size.ts` (not protected) now serves all three hooks from one
  debounced `resize` listener via `useSyncExternalStore`. The unused
  `debounceDelay` parameter was dropped.
- `mode="forward"` `scroll` listeners in `<Spring>` / `<Inview>` made `passive`.
- Hard rule #2 amended: the engine stays protected by default; changes require
  explicit sign-off.

**Consequences.** A page with N animated components now runs **one** rAF loop and
**one** resize listener instead of N of each, with no observer churn. Public
hook/component APIs are unchanged except `useWindowWidth`/`Height`/`Size`, which
no longer take a `debounceDelay` argument (no caller passed one). This **amends
ADR-0002's** do-not-modify scope.

A follow-up pass then cleared all 13 pre-existing ESLint problems in the engine
(also authorized): `isMobileDisabled` gained an optional `viewportWidth`
argument, missing `disableOnMobile` effect deps were added, a
`trigger.current`-in-cleanup hazard in `<Hover>` was fixed, `<Handle>`'s
transition effects were ref-stabilised, and `useProgressTrigger` now returns
`progress` as a `RefObject<number>` (no consumer affected).

## ADR-0008 — Adaptive scaling grid via root font-size

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** An adaptive scaling system was dropped into `src/components/common/`
to keep a rem-based design proportional across viewports. It shipped as a
`styled-components` implementation (`createGlobalStyle`, a `css` `media` helper,
`rm`/`em` helpers, plus `colors.ts` / `fonts.ts` / `utils.ts`). `styled-components`
is not a project dependency, and global CSS belongs in `globals.css` per ADR-0004.

**Decision.** Keep only the scaling behaviour; rebuild it to the project stack.
- **Scale down** (viewport ≤ largest breakpoint) — `vw`-based `html { font-size }`
  media queries in `globals.css`, inside `@layer base`.
- **Scale up** (viewport > largest breakpoint) — a `<AdaptiveGrid>` client
  component (`useAdaptiveGrid` hook) sets an inline `html` font-size at runtime,
  reusing the existing `useResizeLoop` render loop.
- Breakpoints live in `grid.config.ts` as typed config; the `globals.css` media
  queries mirror them and must be kept in sync (formula in both files).
- The dropped `styled-components` files were deleted, not committed.

**Consequences.** A rem-based layout now scales as one unit on every viewport.
`styled-components` stays out of the dependency tree. The breakpoint set is
duplicated across `grid.config.ts` and `globals.css` by design — the CSS-only
config rule (ADR-0004) forbids generating the media queries from JS.

## ADR-0007 — Automate the vault workflow with Claude Code hooks

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** The "read the vault first, follow the relevant guide, update the docs
after every change" workflow depended on the user reminding the agent each time.
Documentation drifts the moment it relies on memory.

**Decision.** Encode the workflow as Claude Code hooks in `.claude/settings.json`
(committed, team-wide):
- `SessionStart` — injects a pointer to read the vault first.
- `UserPromptSubmit` — on every request, reminds the agent to consult the relevant
  guide and to update docs for any change made.
- `Stop` — at the end of every turn, blocks **once** to confirm the vault was
  updated. A `${TMPDIR}` marker keyed by session id guarantees it blocks at most
  once per turn (no infinite loop).

**Consequences.** The documentation workflow is enforced without user prompting.
`.claude/settings.json` is now a tracked project file. Hooks are reviewable and
disableable via `/hooks`. New hooks take effect on the next session start (or after
opening `/hooks`). See [[ai-agent-guide]].

## ADR-0006 — The vault is the single source of truth

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** ADR-0001 left dense spec files (`project-specs.md`, `text-engine-docs.md`)
at the repo root alongside the vault, creating duplication — the same conventions
existed both as terse specs and as expanded vault notes, which would drift.

**Decision.** The vault is the **only** documentation source.
- `project-specs.md` — deleted; its content was already decomposed into the
  `architecture/` and `frontend/` notes (and `environment-variables.md`).
- `text-engine-docs.md` — moved into the vault as [[text-engine-reference]].
- `generic-layout-prompt.md` — moved into the vault (see ADR via [[changelog]]).
- Root keeps only thin shims: `AGENTS.md` carries the breaking-change warning and
  hard rules and points into the vault; `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursorrules` both
  `@`-import `AGENTS.md`.

**Consequences.** No documentation duplication. Agents bootstrap from `AGENTS.md`
and read vault notes on demand. This **amends ADR-0001** — root files no longer
hold canonical spec content.

## ADR-0005 — Use standard `next/link` for navigation

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** Two conflicting conventions existed: `project-specs.md` specified
standard `next/link` / `useRouter`, while `generic-layout-prompt.md` specified
custom `<AnimLink>` / `useAnimRouter()` wrappers. The custom wrappers were never
built.

**Decision.** Use standard Next.js navigation — `<Link>` from `next/link` and
`useRouter` from `next/navigation`. The `AnimLink` / `useAnimRouter` convention is
dropped. See [[routing]].

**Consequences.** `generic-layout-prompt.md` §5 updated to match. No animated-route-
transition layer exists; if one is needed later, revisit with a new ADR.

## ADR-0001 — Adopt an Obsidian vault as the project brain

- **Status:** Accepted — amended by ADR-0006
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** Project knowledge was scattered across root markdown files
(`project-specs.md`, `text-engine-docs.md`, `AGENTS.md`). New contributors and AI
agents had no structured map of the system.

**Decision.** Introduce `obsidian/` as an Obsidian vault — a linked, navigable
second brain. Root spec files remain as machine-read sources; the vault expands on
them. See [[ai-agent-guide]].

**Consequences.** Docs must now be maintained alongside code. The vault is the
canonical place to *understand* the project; root files stay canonical for *tooling*.

## ADR-0002 — All motion is spring-based (`@react-spring/web`)

- **Status:** Accepted (inherited from starter)
- **Date:** Project baseline

**Context.** Marketing sites need rich, interruptible, physically natural motion.
CSS transitions and keyframes are rigid; competing libraries add weight.

**Decision.** Use `@react-spring/web` for every animation. A custom component layer
(`src/components/animation/springs/`) wraps it. CSS transitions, CSS keyframes, and
`framer-motion` are **banned**.

**Consequences.** All animation goes through the [[animation-system]]. The springs
folder is `#do-not-modify`. Text animation is delegated to [[text-engine]].

---

## ADR-0003 — Routes delegate to Views

- **Status:** Accepted (inherited from starter)
- **Date:** Project baseline

**Context.** Mixing routing concerns with page UI makes `app/` files heavy and hard
to test.

**Decision.** `app/**/page.tsx` files only import and render a component from
`src/views/`. All layout/UI logic lives in the view. See [[routing]].

**Consequences.** Every route is a 3-line file. Views are the real page components.

## ADR-0004 — Tailwind v4 with CSS-based config

- **Status:** Accepted (inherited from starter)
- **Date:** Project baseline

**Context.** Tailwind v4 removes `tailwind.config.js` in favour of CSS-native config.

**Decision.** All theme tokens live in `globals.css` under `:root` and `@theme inline`.
No JS config file. Raw values in class names are banned. See [[design-system]].

**Consequences.** Design tokens are the only styling currency. New values must be
added to `globals.css` first.
