# Catalog — Common Components

Files in `src/components/common/` — shared infrastructure that may depend on
providers. Conventions: [[component-conventions]].

## Cookie — `Cookie/`

Self-contained cookie consent system — a bottom-right **banner** plus a full
category **preferences modal**. No third-party library (the old
`react-cookie-consent` dependency was removed). Lives in `src/components/common/Cookie/`.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `Cookie.tsx` | Mount component — hydrates the store, renders banner + modal |
| `LazyCookie.tsx` | `next/dynamic` `ssr:false` wrapper — keeps cookie JS out of first-load |
| `CookieBanner.tsx` | Bottom-right consent banner |
| `CookiePreferencesModal.tsx` | Category preferences dialog with per-category toggles |
| `CookieButton.tsx` | Local button primitive — `primary` / `secondary` variants |
| `cookieStore.ts` | Zustand store + `localStorage` persistence |
| `index.ts` | Barrel exports — `Cookie`, `LazyCookie`, `useCookieStore`, `CookieConsent` |

**Mounting** — the root layout renders `<LazyCookie />` inside `ScrollLayout`:
```tsx
import { LazyCookie } from "@/components/common/Cookie";
```

**State** — `useCookieStore` (Zustand). `consent` is `null` until the user decides;
the banner shows only after hydration confirms `consent === null`. Persisted to
`localStorage` under key `cookie-consent-v1`. Three categories: `necessary`
(always on), `analytics`, `marketing`.

**Styling & motion** — ported to the project stack: Tailwind v4 with the
`background` / `foreground` design tokens (dark-mode adaptive, no hardcoded hex),
and `@react-spring/web` for all motion — `useTransition` drives the banner and
modal mount/unmount, `useSpring` drives the toggle knob. No CSS transitions.
The modal locks scroll through the Lenis [[smooth-scroll|scroll store]]
(`useScroll.stop()`), not `body` overflow.

> [!note] `#todo`
> The privacy-policy link points to `/privacy-policy` — that route does not exist
> yet. Placeholder consent copy should be reviewed before launch.

## Skeleton loaders

Three skeleton components for `loading` states of async-data components — every
async component must mirror its final layout with one of these
(see [[component-conventions]]).

| Component | File | For |
|-----------|------|-----|
| `<SkeletonImage>` | `skeleton-image.tsx` | image placeholders |
| `<SkeletonLoader>` | `skeleton-loader.tsx` | generic block placeholders |
| `<SkeletonVideo>` | `skeleton-video.tsx` | video placeholders |

> [!note]
> `components/ui/` (design-system primitives) does not exist yet — create it when
> the first primitive is added. See [[folder-structure]].
